I worked on this project by following the Pwc virtual Experience on power BI at Forage.

Description about my project:

Introduction

This is an analysis of call center data over a 3 month period in 2021, including call volume, topics, resolution rates, agent performance, and customer satisfaction.
Exploring the Data

There were a total of 5000 calls over the 3 month period.
The most common call topics were Contract related (20.14%), Payment related (20.44%), and Streaming (20.38%).
81% of calls were answered, while 19% went unanswered.
Average speed to answer was 54.75 seconds.
A total of 3646 calls were resolved by agents.
Analyzing Key Metrics

Call volume was highest in January with 1772 calls. It dipped in February and March. This could be seasonal based on time of year.
8 agents handled all 5000 calls. All had similar call volumes and resolution rates.
Resolution rate was 73% (3646 resolved out of 5000 total). This is a key customer service metric to track.
Average satisfaction rating was 2.76 out of 5. Identifying drivers of satisfaction could improve this.
Identifying Insights

Contract, Payment and Streaming make up over 60% of call drivers. Improving self-service options in these areas could reduce call volume.
Peak call times are 9-11am and 3-5pm. Aligning staffing to call volume could improve speed to answer.
Satisfaction is relatively low. Linking satisfaction to first call resolution could identify opportunities to improve.
Presenting Recommendations

Invest in self-service options for common call drivers to decrease volume.
Adjust staffing model to align with peak call times.
Set a goal to improve satisfaction rating to 4+ out of 5. Focus on first call resolution.
In summary, the data shows opportunities to improve call volume, operational efficiency and customer satisfaction through targeted investments in self-service, staffing realignment and resolution procedures. A data-driven approach helps identify key metrics, insights and potential recommendations.

I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for providing me with the opportunity to showcase my skills in call center trends analysis using PowerBI. I appreciate the chance to contribute to the process and demonstrate my capabilities. Thank you!..
